# Mathematical-Statements-Application
An application that interacts with users to evaluate logical operations on given inputs and generates truth tables. The application can be displayed on the web or in the terminal. The goal is to reinforce your understanding of conjunction, disjunction, negation, implication, and biconditional statements through practical implementation.

## Objectives:
Implement logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, IF...THEN, IF AND ONLY IF) in a program.
Create a user interface (web or terminal) to accept inputs for A and B.
Display the results of the logical operations based on user inputs.
Generate a truth table showing all possible values of A and B and the results of logical operations.

## Note:
### LogicalOperations.java
Contains methods to compute conjunction (AND), disjunction (OR), negation (NOT), implication (IF...THEN), and biconditional (IF AND ONLY IF).
Display the results of these operations based on the user inputs. Also has a method to generate and display a truth table.

### Main.java
Accept user inputs for A and B (either as boolean values or 0/1).
